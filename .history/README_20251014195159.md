# Blaze - React SaaS Landing Page

This project is a modern, responsive landing page template based on the **Blaze** design, fully implemented using **React** and **SCSS** (Sass). It is designed for software as a service (SaaS) products, agencies, and startup websites.

The implementation focuses on converting the static HTML/CSS template into modular React components, ensuring high performance and maintainability.
